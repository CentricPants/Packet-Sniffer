# Packet Sniffer â€“ Kali Linux GUI Tool

This is a GUI-based Packet Sniffer built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **Scapy**.  
It allows real-time network traffic capture, supports protocol filtering, and logs the captured data for analysis.

This was developed as a personal project to explore how packet sniffing works and to gain hands-on experience with low-level networking.
